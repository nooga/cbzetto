# CBZetto

**Like Alacritty, but for CBZ files.**

A stupid-fast, minimal CBZ reader for macOS ‚Äî written in Zig and powered by Raylib.
Built out of pure spite for slow manga viewers and an unhealthy obsession with scroll performance.

CBZetto does one thing ‚Äî scroll _HUGE_ comics quickly.

## Features

üöÄ **GPU-accelerated** - Smooth like buttered shame  
üßµ **Background threaded** - No stutters, ever  
üß† **Smart memory** - ~200MB RAM usage max  
üßº **Minimal UI** - No clutter, no nonsense  
üçé **Native macOS** - Proper app bundle with file associations

## Requirements

- **Zig** 0.13.0
- **macOS** 10.12 or later
- **Xcode Command Line Tools**
- **raylib** 4.5.0+

## Usage

CBZetto opens:

1. **A folder with CBZ files** ‚Üí Shows them in order (recommended)
2. **A single CBZ file** ‚Üí Opens that comic

```bash
# Development
zig build run -- /path/to/folder/with/cbz/files

# Release build
./build_release.sh
open CBZetto.app --args /path/to/comics/
```

Hit `h` for help once it's running.

## Building

If you're one of the 7 people on Earth writing Zig apps for fun, you already know:

```bash
zig build run -- /path/to/comics/
```

Everyone else: just use the `.dmg` from releases.

The `build_release.sh` script creates a proper macOS app bundle with:

- ReleaseFast optimization
- Stripped debug symbols
- Multi-resolution app icon
- File associations for CBZ/CBR
- Distribution packages

## Dependencies

- **raylib** - For not sucking at graphics
- **macOS Frameworks** - CoreFoundation, AppKit, OpenGL

Managed by Zig's package system via `build.zig.zon`.

## Disclaimer

Despite what the icon might suggest, CBZetto:

- Works with any CBZ file
- Does not come with manga preloaded
- Will absolutely remember what you were reading if someone walks in
